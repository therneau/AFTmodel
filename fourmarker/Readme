This is an addition to the original archive, for an application of the AFT
approach to a data set with four markers: amyloid PET, tau PET, white matter
hyperintensity, and fractional anisotropy.

  stanfit.R:  R code to run the stan fit, on simulated data
  simdata.rds: Simulated data
  aft4.stan:  The stan program, which is called by stanfit.R

Note the final line of stanfit.R, which is save the result to disk.  The fit can
take a long while to run (over a day).  A later program will read this in to 
produce tables and graphs; usually many times as a paper is refined.

simdata.rds is a stacked dataset with multiple observations per person, per 
outcome.  The number of measurements will vary from person to person.  For 
example, one person might have two outcomes measured twice each while another 
person all four outcomes measured three times each.  This dataset has 9 
variables:

  id       unique subject identifier

  y        outcome value 

  outcome  a number from 1 to 4 where
           1=log of Amyloid PET SUVR
           2=log of tau PET SUVR
           3=WMH%
           4=1 - FA in the GCC

  age      age at measurement in years

  male     male sex
           1=male, 0=female

  apoepos  APOE ùúÄ4 carrier 
           1=carrier, 0=not carrier or unknown

  apoemiss missing/unknown APOE genotype 
           1=unknown, 0=carrier or not carrier

  educ     years of education

  adrc     referred to ADRC
           1=referred, 0=not referred
